									Maha is the sweetest gal you can meet. She helped 
									me stress less about my daughters first year birthday cake.She made a 
									minion cake for her and the details came out perfect and it was just what 
									I wanted! Her price is veryreasonable and trust me when she says she needs
									time in advance to know if she can make your cake or not. She&apos;s not greedy
									and will not take you if she doesnt have time to make it. In other words 
									she will not rush. The cake was not too sweet I got nutella flavor my cake
									was fondant. If you choose maha its a good choice!

									I was looking for a Minecraft cake in a short order for 
									my visiting niece, and I was referred to Maha. I called her up on a Sunday and she
									asked for a couple images as inspiration. I quickly emailed some ideas and she said no 
									problem at all. She only took 4 days to put something together, despite her minimum 
									order time of a week.I went for the cookies and cream one, on a whim, and not to 
									exaggerate, the cake was incredible. Visually the detail was fantastic, but more 
									importantly the cake was delicious. I'm fairly sure the adults ate more than the kids:)
									The price was right, Maha was incredible to deal with, and I'll definitely be reaching 
									out when I need cakes for events or small parties! Thank you!

									I ordered a Las Vegas themed cake for my best friend's party.  
									It was definitely a highlight and impressed all the guests just on the design.  
									Once we had a taste, we were totally blown away!!  Moist, delicious, and memorable.
									5 stars because of her awesome cake!
									Added bonuses:
									-- prices are totally reasonable
									-- Maha is very responsive and professional
									-- her work is very clean
									-- Honest! I remember I put a little extra on the check and they pointed it out 
									thinking the amount was an error.  
									Maha is truly gifted.  She's what makes her treats Sweet!
